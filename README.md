Given all ipynb files

Implemented all mentioned models for all the tree tasks

Task 1 (Same Method or Not) Given two texts T1 and T2, determine if both T1 and T2
are generated by the same NLG method (or human) or not.
● Task 2 (Human vs. Machine) Given a text T1, determine if T1 is written by humans or
generated by one of k NLG methods.
● Task 3 (Authorship Attribution) Given a synthetic text T1, single out one NLG method
(among k alternatives) that generated T1.

Provided all csv final datafiles to pass the data to models and run the model to get accuracy precision and recall
